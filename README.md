# Burglar-Alarm
This is a Burglar Alarm system programmed on Arduino IDE and Matlab.

The system runs on hardware that includes a buzzer, keypad, sensors, an actuator, and a camera. 
The code on Arduino runs the general program controlling the sensors and actuators however it communicates with Matlab which runs the other part of the code which prints instructions to the screen as well as runs face recognition.
All the details of the system along with flowchart diagrams are included in the "Burgular Alarm Project Details.pdf File.

It is important to note that the facial recognition algorithm included in the code is a development of a program written by Brett Shoelson.
The original facial recognition files and script written by Brett can be found on:
